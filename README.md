# dslParser

An experimtental project to parse DSLs. DSL are psuedo languages that are notoriously difficult to refactor.
One poetential use of a DSL parser is a built-in editor's intelli-sense engine.
The ultimate goal would be to create a full blown language for your dsl that supports refactoring and things like finding all references 
and dependencies.
No more no less

Included in this project is a SignalR Chat Hub implementation.
